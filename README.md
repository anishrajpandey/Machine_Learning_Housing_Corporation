# 🏠 Machine Learning Housing Corporation

This project is a hands-on implementation of a **housing price prediction model**, based on real-world California housing data. It is inspired by and follows along with the book _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ by Aurélien Géron.

The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning pipeline that can **predict median house values** using a variety of input features such as population, location, median income, and more.

> ⚠️ This repository is currently under development as part of my ML learning journey.
